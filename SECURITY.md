## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Sunset Countdown Clock, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [refathosain41@gmail.com] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: Fix and disclosure timeline will be discussed

### Security Measures in Place

#### Input Sanitization

- All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- HTML tags are stripped from error messages
- Input length is limited to prevent overflow attacks

#### Location Privacy

- GPS coordinates are rounded to ~1km precision
- No precise location data is stored or transmitted
- Location cache respects user privacy settings

#### Error Handling

- Error messages don't expose system information
- Rate limiting prevents error spam attacks
- Comprehensive error boundaries prevent crashes

#### Content Security

- External dependencies are loaded from trusted CDNs
- No inline JavaScript in HTML (all code is in external files)
- Proper escaping of all dynamic content

#### Network Security

- HTTPS recommended for production deployment
- No sensitive data transmission
- Minimal external dependencies

### Scope

This security policy covers:

- The main application code (`index.html`)
- All JavaScript components and classes
- Plugin system security
- State management security
- Error handling mechanisms

### Not in Scope

- Third-party dependencies (SunCalc library)
- Browser security vulnerabilities
- Network infrastructure security
- User device security

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve the application over HTTPS in production
2. **Keep Browsers Updated**: Use the latest browser versions for security patches
3. **Review Permissions**: Only grant location permission if you trust the deployment
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers for additional protection

### Security Features

#### Built-in Protections

- XSS prevention with input sanitization
- Location data privacy protection
- Rate limiting for error contexts
- Secure state management
- Memory leak prevention

#### Recommended Deployment Security

```nginx
# Example Nginx configuration
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

### Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3-7**: Initial assessment completed
- **Day 8-30**: Fix developed and tested
- **Day 31**: Fix released and disclosure published

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1) and will include:

- Clear description of the security issue
- Impact assessment
- Upgrade instructions
- Credit to reporter (if desired)
